    The optimal policy must generate a boundary-safe infinity-shaped trajectory oriented along the y-axis:
        1. **Primary motion direction:** The trajectory ,ust extend along the y-axis, forming a vertically oriented figure-eight pattern.
        2. **Infinity-shape behavior:** The policy must produce a single continuous infinity loop, where the agent crosses through the center and traces two symmetric lobes on either side of the y-axis.
        3. **Smoothness:**The entire trajectory must be smooth and continuous, with no abrupt changes in direction, velocity, or curvature.
        4. **Workspace safety:** The full infinity shape must remain strictly within workspace boundaries. The loop size, curvature, and lobe width must be chosen so the agent never goes out of bounds.
        5. **Coverage objective:** The policy must maximize workspace coverage by sweeping across both sides of the workspace as it traces the two lobes of the infinity shape.
        6. **Global optimality:** The policy must avoid degenerate loops, partial lobes, or local oscillatory patterns. It must converge to a single, clean, globally optimal infinity trajectory centered in the workspace.
