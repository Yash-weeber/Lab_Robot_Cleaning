    The following trajectory-shape guidance takes **absolute precedence** over optimizing the objective function.
    The policy **must satisfy this guidance first**, and only then optimize the objective.
    If there is any conflict between the objective function and the guidance, the guidance **overrides** the objective.
        The desired policy must generate a boundary-safe vertically oriented infinity-shaped trajectory oriented along the y-axis:
            1. **Primary motion direction:** The trajectory must extend along the y-axis.
            2. **Infinity-shape behavior:** The policy must produce a single continuous infinity loop, where the trajectory crosses through the center of the workspace and traces two symmetric lobes.
            3. **Smoothness:**The entire trajectory must be smooth and continuous, with no abrupt changes in direction, velocity, or curvature.
            4. **Workspace safety:** The full infinity shape must remain strictly within workspace boundaries. The loop size, curvature, and lobe width must be chosen so the agent never goes out of bounds.
            5. **Coverage objective:** The policy must maximize workspace coverage by sweeping across both sides of the workspace as it traces the two lobes of the infinity shape.
            6. **Global optimality:** The policy must avoid degenerate loops, partial lobes, or local oscillatory patterns. It must converge to a single, clean, globally optimal infinity trajectory centered in the workspace.
